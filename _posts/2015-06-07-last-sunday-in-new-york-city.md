It's my last Sunday in New York City. Dusk approaches, and I soon need to pack my things for San Francisco.

I'm sitting alone in my office on the 24th floor in Midtown, the heart of Manhattan. The floor is quiet, filled with empty desks.

A melody sneaks in. It's a jazz trumpeter busking on the streets below. His notes barely make it up to the 24th floor, but I open the window to let it in.

He cycles through some classics (Autumn Leaves, My Funny Valentine, Summertime) like he's been playing them his whole life. Occasionally, the sirens, taxis and garbage trucks drown him out. But he keeps on playing.

It made me happy, but I don't know why. I'm going to miss this city. I walk down to the street to give him a tip, but he's already gone.
