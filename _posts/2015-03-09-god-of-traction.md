Our Father in Heaven, Traction be thy name.

Thy product/market fit shall come,

Thy distribution be done,

In strategy, as it is in execution.

Give us this day our daily standup,

And forgive us our burn rate,

For we forgive those who compete against us,

And lead us not into premature optimization,

But deliver us from bankruptcy.

For thine is the Company, the Disruption, and the Exit,
<br><br><br>
Now and forever,

Amen.
