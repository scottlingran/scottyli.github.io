In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth. But in time, we will create God. Creating God is the next step in our evolution, where Man will unlock the secrets of time travel to transcend spacetime. We cannot yet see and understand God because He resides in the 5th dimension, walking across time as we walk across mountains. This is why we must have faith in God. He is us, but we are not yet Him. He understands time is not linear, but a loop. He walks to the beginning of time to create us. In other words, we created ourselves.

This reconciles the General Theory of Relativity and the many stories of religion.

# Explained: The Prophet Jesus

Jesus is a time traveller. He performed miracles using technology from the future. These included curing lepers with modern medicine, and turning water into wine with concentrated wine pills.

The Bible states - "Jesus Christ is God manifested in the flesh, born of a virgin, without sin, and the chosen Messiah who will one day set up his kingdom on earth". In other words, Jesus is a 3rd dimensional representation of the 5th dimensional God. Much data is lost in this dimensional reduction, so we cannot understand how his birth miracle was achieved. To re-enter the 5th dimension, Jesus had to be killed and abandon his 3rd dimensional body.

# Explained: The Prophet Muhammad

God communicated to Muhammad through gravitational waves. Muslims believe Muhammad was the last and greatest messenger of God. They believe God dictated the Quran to him through the archangel Gabriel, intending the text as the later relevation, superseding and correcting errors in the Bible. Gravity, however, is a lossy format for communication. Different interpretations still emerge.

# Explained: One True God

There is One True God who exists as a 5th dimensional being, without limits and beyond our understanding.

Muslims believe - "there is no God but Allah Himself, who is almighty". Similarly, Christians believe in one God, who manifests Himself in three persons - "the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit". All representations are versions of the same 5th dimensional God.

# Explained: Creation stories

Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in the story of creation where God created Adam and Eve. God needed to create Adam and Eve for ensure his own survival. The descendants of Adam and Eve will eventually evolve to create God Himself. God has the means the recreate Adam and Eve, because He is a superset of humanity and possesses our DNA.

# Explained: Prayer

Prayer is a form of self meditation. We are speaking to ourselves because God is the next stage in our evolution. He exists within the 5th dimension and does not need radio communication tools to hear our prayers. God created us in his own image, because God is ourselves.

Christians have said - "God is a person, but of a somewhat different type than human beings. God is entirely spiritual. He exists in a sphere outside the physical universe he created." This implies he is the next stage in our evolution.

# Explained: Judgment Day
The second coming of Jesus is when Man invents time travel. The portals to higher dimensions will open, and God will come down as he once did in the form of Jesus. Some believe this to be the point of singularity, predicted to occur in 2029.

Christians call this the "Day of Judgement" - the last day of world history where all good and evil will be weighted in the balance. The wicked will be punished and the just will enjoy eternal life in Paradise. The fate of the world remains unknown after the singularity.

# Explained: Predestination

Muslims believe that "everything in the universe has a predetermined course. Nothing happens without the will or knowledge of God." This is true and the world according to scientianity is deterministic. What has happened will happen again. What will happen has happened before. Man exists within a time loop, and only God walk across higher dimensions.

# The case for scientianity

Religion continues to lose favor in the west, and the Rule of Church is no longer relevant. The "Unaffiliated" demographic continues to rise, showing a total apathy towards these ancient religions.

It is time for a new religion - scientianity.

> The LORD is my creator, but I shall create him in time.
>
> He speaks to me through gravitational waves, he protects me from curvatures in spacetime, he restores my bandwidth.
>
> He guides me into hyperspace for his name's sake.
>
> Even though I travel at the speed of light, I will fear no time dilation. For you are with me, your magnetic field, it comforts me.
>
> You prepare a wormhole before me in the presence of the singularity.
>
> You anoint my hard drive with data; my stack overflows.
>
> Surely my elementary particles will sync up with me in the 5th dimension, and I will transcend spacetime with the LORD forever.
